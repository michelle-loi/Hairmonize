# Getting started 

Clone this project from git onto your computer

To run:

1) open the terminal cd to the front end directory
2) We need to install some dependencies for the react icons, so run npm install react-icons (
you can read more about it below)
3) enter command: npm install
4) enter command: npm start


There are a bunch of frameworks we need so:

This is for our icons:
    npm install react-icons

To use it:

import { the_icon_you_want } from "react-icons/fa";

The icon website is: https://fontawesome.com/icons
